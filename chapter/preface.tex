% In Part I, we will study the basic concepts and several
% mathematical definitions required to understand what convex optimization is as well as how to
% translate an interested problem into a convex problem. We will then explore five instances of
% convex optimization problems: LP, least-squares, QP, SOCP and SDP. Specifically we will focus
% on techniques which serve recognizing (and translating to) such problems. We will also study
% some prominent algorithms for solving such problems. 
% \par
% In Part II, we will study one of the key
% theories in the optimization field, called duality. There are two types of dualities: (1) strong
% duality; (2) weak duality. It turns out that the strong duality is quite useful for gaining some
% algorithmic insights for convex problems. 
% The weal duality helps dealing with difficult non-convex problems, by providing an approximated solution.
% \par 
% In part III, our focus is on continuous optimization (rather than discrete optimization) with special emphasis on nonlinear programming.
% We will Utilize the knowledge of PartI and PartII to mine the optimal solution conditions and 
% solving methods for nonlinear optimization problems.
